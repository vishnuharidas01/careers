## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Mobile Application Developer role within MUFG Retirement Solutions. With over nine years of experience building and managing consumer mobile applications across iOS and Android, I bring strong expertise in React Native, JavaScript, and enterprise-grade mobile engineering practices.

Throughout my career, I have built and maintained client-facing mobile applications focused on performance, scalability, and user experience. My work has involved integrating mobile apps with backend services using secure API integration patterns, implementing unit and system integration testing, and ensuring structured release management aligned with governance standards.

I have implemented CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines and DevOps automation workflows to streamline build and deployment processes. While my direct experience has primarily involved AWS and EAS-based pipelines, the automation, configuration management, and release governance principles are directly transferable to Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines. I am comfortable working within structured change management procedures and maintaining documentation aligned with security and data privacy guidelines.

In previous roles, I have collaborated closely with UI, backend, QA, and product stakeholders to deliver end-to-end mobile solutions. I have led code reviews, mentored engineers, and contributed to best practice standards for mobile app development. My approach emphasizes high-quality code, secure development practices, and continuous improvement in DevOps and deployment efficiency.

I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to MUFG’s digital and member experience product offerings and to support the Retirement Solutions technology team in delivering reliable, scalable, and secure mobile applications.

Kind regards,
Vishnu Haridas
