## Why I'm a fit

**Greenfield Frontend Rebuild & Modern TypeScript Frameworks (React Ideal)**
I have built and scaled cross-platform applications using React Native and TypeScript, implementing clean architecture patterns (MVVM, Clean Architecture) and reusable UI modules. My experience designing modular, reusable components directly supports contributing to an internal component library and establishing frontend consistency across products.

**Web Application Development, REST APIs, and WebSockets**
Delivered real-time functionality using WebSockets (Pusher) and REST APIs in distributed environments. Integrated GraphQL and serverless backends (AWS Lambda), ensuring reliable frontend–backend communication and scalable service integration.

**Distributed Systems & Microservices Infrastructure**
Worked with AWS Lambda, GraphQL services, and decoupled local development from cloud production environments. Engineered schema-aware solutions to support microservices-style architecture and eliminate environment dependency blockers.

**Unix/Linux & Operational Responsibility**
Comfortable running and debugging services in Unix environments. Resolved production-impacting build failures, implemented unit testing strategies, and maintained service reliability with CI/CD discipline and release management practices.

**Security & Scalable Systems**
Experience in secure API integration, mobile security best practices, encrypted QR workflows, payment integrations (Stripe), and defensive programming patterns. Built offline-first architectures and high-reliability BLE systems for enterprise-grade applications.

**Start-up / Scale-up Environment**
Freelance and scale-up experience delivering features from conceptualisation to realisation under tight timelines, collaborating closely with backend and product teams.

**Component-Driven & Workflow Simplification**
Implemented reusable forms, schema-driven validation, modular UI systems, and performance optimisations aligned with streamlined user experience goals similar to a “one-click” philosophy.

**Aligned with ATS Best Practices**
Resume structured according to ATS formatting standards  and based strictly on verified profile and resume data  .

**Keyword Pack:**
TypeScript, React, Web Application Development, REST APIs, WebSockets, Distributed Systems, Microservices Infrastructure, Unix/Linux, AWS, Continuous Delivery, Automated Testing, Security Software Development, Docker, GitLab, Redux.

## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Frontend Engineer position within the Access Portal Team at DroneShield. With over nine years of experience developing secure, scalable client-facing applications, I bring strong expertise in TypeScript-based development, distributed systems integration, and modern engineering practices aligned with high-growth technology environments.

Throughout my career, I have designed and delivered production-grade applications using React Native and TypeScript, integrating REST APIs, WebSockets, and serverless backend services within AWS environments. In recent roles, I resolved critical GraphQL service failures, decoupled local development from cloud production environments, and implemented automated testing strategies to ensure regression-free deployments. I take operational responsibility seriously and prioritise reliability, maintainability, and continuous delivery.

I am comfortable working in Unix/Linux environments, collaborating across cross-functional teams, and contributing to reusable component-driven architectures. My experience building modular UI systems and enforcing engineering standards aligns strongly with contributing to a cutting-edge component library and supporting a greenfield frontend rebuild.

I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to contribute to a central platform such as the Access Portal, where usability, system reliability, and streamlined workflows are critical. I value sound engineering practices, scalable architecture, and continuous improvement, and I am eager to contribute to DroneShield’s growth and technical excellence.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Vishnu Haridas
