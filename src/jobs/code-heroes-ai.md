## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Software Developer role with a focus on Flutter-based mobile and web solutions. With over nine years of commercial software development experience, I have delivered secure, scalable, client-facing mobile applications across iOS, Android, and cross-platform environments.

My recent experience spans cross-platform architecture, AWS and Firebase backend integration, CI/CD automation, and AI feature integration. At Kois.ai, I integrated LLM-driven capabilities into production mobile applications, working closely with backend and AI teams to validate AI outputs for quality, performance, and reliability. I have also designed schema-aware GraphQL solutions, implemented serverless AWS Lambda integrations, and improved local development workflows aligned with Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) standards.

I approach development as both a system designer and a coder. Whether implementing offline-first architectures, BLE/UWB integrations, or backend-integrated ticketing systems, I focus on clean, testable, maintainable code and structured release processes. I am comfortable working in remote-first agile teams, contributing through async communication, sprint ceremonies, and cross-functional collaboration under challenging deadlines.

While my primary cross-platform experience has been in React Native, the architectural discipline, state management patterns, and performance considerations translate directly into Flutter environments. I am confident in delivering high-quality mobile and web applications while championing the safe and productive use of AI within development workflows.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team’s mission of building robust, AI-aware systems for your clients.

Kind regards,
Vishnu Haridas
